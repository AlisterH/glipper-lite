Glipper - Clipboardmanager for Gnome
====================================

Copyright (C) 2006 Sven Rech <svenrech@gmx.de>


Introduction
============

Glipper is a clipboardmanager for GNOME (and other WMs). You can see this as a
GNOME counterpart to KDE's Klipper. But it only depends on GTK+ 2 and NOT on
GNOME libs, so you can also use it with any other window manager that supports
tray icons.

Installation Manual
===================

The best solution for installing Glipper, if you are using a GNU/Linux, BSD or
other distribution, is to use your software management system. If you cannot
install Glipper with your system management software you can compile it from
sourcecode.


Dependancies
------------

To use Glipper you must have these libraries installed on your system :

	gtk+
	libglade

You must also have a freedesktop compliant notification area or system tray
running.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

The first step is to compile the source code. Decompress the source archive if
you have not already done so. Open a terminal and CD to the directory where
your source code is, then type :

	./configure
	make

Once the compilation has finished, you may install the software (root access
needed). Run as root:

	make install


uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall (as root):

	make uninstall
