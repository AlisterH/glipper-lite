Installation
=============
Execute the following steps to install glipper:

./configure
make

If you use a Debian based system (like Ubuntu), you better should use this parameters:
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-gconf-schema-file-dir=/usr/share/gconf/schemas

Now you can either install it on your system:
sudo make install (or run make install as root)

Then you are able to add the applet through the gnome-panel applet manager.

Or you can try it without installation, by running
./glipper/glipper -w
