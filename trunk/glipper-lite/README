Glipper - Clipboard manager for Gnome
====================================

Copyright (C) 2006 Sven Rech <svenrech@gmx.de>


Introduction
============

Glipper is a clipboard manager for GNOME (and other WMs). You can see this as a
GNOME counterpart to KDE's Klipper. But it only depends on GTK+ 2 and NOT on
GNOME libs, so you can also use it with any other window manager that supports
tray icons.

Installation Manual
===================

The best solution for installing Glipper, if you are using a GNU/Linux, BSD or
other distribution, is to use your software management system. If you cannot
install Glipper with your system management software you can compile it from
sourcecode.


Dependancies
------------

To use Glipper you must have these libraries installed on your system :

	gtk+

If you use GNOME support (default) you will also require :

	libgnome
	gnome-doc-utils

You must also have a freedesktop compliant notification area or system tray
running.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

The first step is to compile the source code. Decompress the source archive if
you have not already done so.

By default, glipper compiles with GNOME support (Yelp help etc.) to disable
this, add --disable-gnome to the ./configure line.

Open a terminal and CD to the directory where your source code is, then type :

	./configure
	make

Once the compilation has finished, you may install the software (root access
needed). Run as root:

	make install


uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall (as root):

	make uninstall


Notes
=====

By default, glipper will install under /usr, if you want to install it elseware, 
such as in /usr/local, or ~/glipper, run configure with the --prefix=<path>
option.

If you install in a prefix other than /usr, be sure to place a link to the
documentation directory in /usr/share/gnome/help, otherwise Yelp will not be
able to find the documentation (GNOME support only).
