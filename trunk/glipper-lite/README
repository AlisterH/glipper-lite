Glipper-Lite - Clipboard manager for Gnome
====================================

Copyright (C) 2006 Sven Rech


Introduction
============

Glipper-lite is a clipboard manager similar to KDE's Klipper, or Ditto for 
Windows.  It is an old-fashioned system tray icon which provides a history of 
text copied to the X11 clipboard and primary selection.

Glipper-lite only depends on GTK+ 2 and NOT on GNOME libs, so you can also use 
it with any other window manager or panel that supports tray icons.

This is a continuation of the classic C version of Glipper.  The original 
Glipper project moved to Python long ago, first as a GNOME panel applet, and 
later as an "appindicator".  It is now found at https://launchpad.net/glipper.

Installation Manual
===================

The best solution for installing Glipper, if you are using a GNU/Linux, BSD or
other distribution, is to use your software management system. If you cannot
install Glipper with your system management software you can compile it from
sourcecode.


Dependencies
------------

To use Glipper you must have these libraries installed on your system :

	gtk+

If you use GNOME support (default) you will also require :

	libgnome
	gnome-doc-utils

You must also have a freedesktop compliant notification area or system tray
running.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

The first step is to compile the source code. Decompress the source archive if
you have not already done so.

By default, glipper compiles with GNOME support (Yelp help etc.) to disable
this, add --disable-gnome to the ./configure line.

Open a terminal and CD to the directory where your source code is, then type :

	./configure
	make

Once the compilation has finished, you may install the software (root access
needed). Run as root:

	make install


uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall (as root):

	make uninstall


Notes
=====

By default, glipper will install under /usr, if you want to install it 
elsewhere, such as in /usr/local, or ~/glipper, run configure with the 
--prefix=<path> option.

If you install in a prefix other than /usr, be sure to place a link to the
documentation directory in /usr/share/gnome/help, otherwise Yelp will not be
able to find the documentation (GNOME support only).
