Glipper-Lite - GTK Clipboard manager
====================================

Copyright (C) 2006 Sven Rech


Introduction
============

Glipper-Lite is a clipboard manager similar to KDE's Klipper, or Ditto for 
Windows.  It is an old-fashioned system tray icon which provides a history of 
text copied to the X11 clipboard and primary selection.

Other clipboard managers you may be interested in include glippy (C#), diodon 
(requires libappindicator, but can run in a traditional systray), parcellite, 
parcellite3 (old gtk3 port), ClipIt (parcellite fork), gpaste (GNOME), 
wmcliphist (windowmaker applet), qlipper (QT)), gcm (GNOME clipboard manager - 
old and broken), anamnesis (PyGTK), copyq (QT), pastie (GNOME)... and many 
"Desktop Environments" include their own clipboard manager.

Glipper-Lite only depends on GTK+ 2 and NOT on GNOME libs, so you can also use 
it with any other window manager or panel that supports tray icons.

This is a continuation of the classic C version of Glipper.  The original 
Glipper project moved to Python long ago, first as a GNOME panel applet, and 
later as an "appindicator".  It is now found at https://launchpad.net/glipper.

Installation Manual
===================

The best solution for installing Glipper-Lite, if you are using a GNU/Linux, BSD or
other distribution, is to use your software management system. If you cannot
install Glipper-Lite with your system management software you can compile it from
sourcecode.


Dependencies
------------

To use Glipper-Lite you must have these libraries installed on your system :

	gtk+

You must also have a freedesktop compliant notification area or system tray
running.


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

The first step is to compile the source code. Decompress the source archive if
you have not already done so.

Open a terminal and CD to the directory where your source code is, then type :

	./configure
	make

Once the compilation has finished, you may install the software (root access
needed). Run as root:

	make install


uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall (as root):

	make uninstall


Notes
=====

By default, Glipper-Lite will install under /usr, if you want to install it 
elsewhere, such as in /usr/local, or ~/glipper, run configure with the 
--prefix=<path> option.
